# Airbnb Analytics DBT Project

## üìñ Overview

This project uses DBT to transform Airbnb data for analytics. It processes listings, hosts, reviews, and booking data.

## üöÄ Getting Started

# Setup Instructions

## üöÄ **Step 1: Load Airbnb Dataset into Snowflake**

### üì• **1.1 Download the Dataset**

- Download Airbnb data from **[Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html)**.
- Choose a dataset for a specific city or region.
- Ensure the dataset is in **CSV format**.

---

### üèó **1.2 Set Up Snowflake Environment**

#### **1.2.1 Create a Snowflake Account**

If you don‚Äôt already have a Snowflake account, sign up for a **free trial** at [Snowflake](https://signup.snowflake.com/).

## **Step 2: Python, Virtualenv Setup, and DBT Installation**

### **2.1: Python Installation**

Download and install **Python 3.10.7** (recommended) from the following link:

üîó [Python 3.10.7 Installer (64-bit)](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.7/python-3.10.7-amd64.exe)

> **Note:** Ensure you are using **Python 3.11** or lower, as newer versions may not be compatible with some `dbt` packages.

---

### **2.2: Virtualenv Setup & DBT Installation - Windows**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Virtual Environment**

Open windows command prompt and run the following commands to create virtual environment:

```sh
cd Desktop
mkdir course
cd course

virtualenv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ dbt installation**

```sh
cd course
virtualenv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install dbt-snowflake==1.9.0 # adjust accordind to compatibility
```

### \*\*3Ô∏è‚É£ dbt setup

Initialize the dbt profiles folder on Windows:

```sh
# create directory to store profiles
mkdir %userprofile%\.dbt

# Create a dbt project (all platforms):
dbt init dbtlearn
```

## **Step 3: Setting up Github Integration**

Follow these steps to set up GitHub in your dbt project:

```sh
# Navigate to your dbt project directory
cd path/to/your/dbt_project

# Initialize a new Git repository
git init

# Make an initial commit
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"

# Add a remote repository (replace with your actual GitHub repo URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-dbt-repo.git

# Push the changes to remote repository,
git push -u origin main

# Create branch development which will be used by developer
git branch development

# Always use development branch to for development
git checkout development
```

> **Note:** I used `main` branch as my production branch for deployment.

After this the project setup is complete and then we can start the development.

# Macros

## 1. `calculate_price_metrics(group_by_column)`

### Purpose:

This macro calculates price-related metrics for Airbnb listings by grouping data based on the specified column. It provides insights into the number of listings, average price, total price, and the total available nights.

### SQL Logic:

- Groups listings by the specified column (e.g., `listing_name`).
- Counts the number of listings (`listing_count`).
- Calculates the average price of listings (`avg_price`).
- Computes the total accumulated price (`total_price`).
- Sums up the `minimum_nights` to get available nights (`available_nights`).
- Filters out listings where `price` is NULL.

### Use Case:

## This macro is useful for generating aggregated price reports based on different groupings, such as by listing name, host, or room type.

## 2. `count_hosts_by_month(year)`

### Purpose:

This macro calculates the number of hosts who joined the platform in each month for a given year.

### SQL Logic:

- Extracts the month from the `created_at` timestamp.
- Formats the month name to a three-letter format (e.g., "Jan", "Feb").
- Counts the number of unique hosts who joined in each month.
- Filters data based on the provided `year` argument.
- Groups by month and orders the results in chronological order.

### Use Case:

## This macro helps in understanding the seasonality of host sign-ups, allowing businesses to analyze trends over time.

## 3. `get_years_from_created_at()`

### Purpose:

This macro dynamically retrieves the distinct years from the `created_at` column in the `dim_hosts_cleansed` model.

### SQL Logic:

- Runs a query to extract unique years from the `created_at` column.
- Sorts the years in ascending order.
- Uses Jinja's `run_query` function to execute the query at runtime.
- Returns the retrieved years as a list.
- Handles execution context to ensure it runs only during query execution.

### Use Case:

## This macro is particularly useful when iterating over different years in dbt models or reports, allowing dynamic and flexible queries without hardcoding year values.

# dbt Snapshots for Airbnb Data

## Overview

This document explains the dbt snapshots created for tracking changes in Airbnb host and listing data over time. Snapshots enable us to capture historical changes in records, ensuring we maintain a history of updates to important attributes.

## Purpose of Snapshots

Snapshots allow us to:

- Track changes in key attributes of hosts and listings.
- Maintain historical records of changes over time.
- Ensure we have accurate insights into when data was modified.
- Support audit requirements and historical trend analysis.

## Snapshot: `raw_hosts_snapshot`

### Definition

The `raw_hosts_snapshot` tracks changes in host details using a timestamp-based strategy.

### Configuration:

- `target_schema='dev'` - Stores snapshots in the `dev` schema.
- `unique_key='unique_id'` - Uniquely identifies each record using a surrogate key.
- `strategy='timestamp'` - Uses the `updated_at` timestamp to track changes.
- `updated_at='updated_at'` - Defines which column indicates an update.
- `invalidate_hard_deletes=True` - Marks deleted records as invalidated instead of removing them.

### Columns Tracked:

- `host_id` - Unique identifier for the host.
- `host_name` - Name of the host.
- `is_superhost` - Indicates if the host is a superhost.
- `created_at` - Timestamp when the host joined.
- `updated_at` - Last update timestamp.

### Unique Identifier:

A surrogate key is generated using:

```sql
{{ dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key(['host_id', 'host_name', 'is_superhost', 'created_at', 'updated_at']) }}
```

This ensures uniqueness even if individual fields change over time.

## Snapshot: `raw_listings_snapshot`

### Definition

The `raw_listings_snapshot` captures changes in listing details, tracking modifications in pricing, availability, and metadata.

### Configuration:

- `target_schema='dev'` - Stores snapshots in the `dev` schema.
- `unique_key='listing_id'` - Uses `listing_id` as the primary key.
- `strategy='timestamp'` - Uses `updated_at` to track modifications.
- `updated_at='updated_at'` - Specifies the update timestamp column.
- `invalidate_hard_deletes=True` - Ensures deleted records are marked invalid.

### Columns Tracked:

- `listing_id` - Unique identifier for the listing.
- `listing_url` - URL of the Airbnb listing.
- `listing_name` - Name of the listing.
- `room_type` - Type of room (e.g., Private room, Entire home, etc.).
- `minimum_nights` - Minimum number of nights required for booking.
- `host_id` - Foreign key referencing the host.
- `price_str` - Price per night for the listing.
- `created_at` - Timestamp when the listing was created.
- `updated_at` - Last update timestamp.
