### üèó **1.2 Set Up Snowflake Environment**

#### **1.2.1 Create a Snowflake Account**

If you don‚Äôt already have a Snowflake account, sign up for a **free trial** at [Snowflake](https://signup.snowflake.com/).

## **Step 2: Python, Virtualenv Setup, and DBT Installation**

### **2.1: Python Installation**

Download and install **Python 3.10.7** (recommended) from the following link:

üîó [Python 3.10.7 Installer (64-bit)](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.7/python-3.10.7-amd64.exe)

> **Note:** Ensure you are using **Python 3.11** or lower, as newer versions may not be compatible with some `dbt` packages.

---

### **2.2: Virtualenv Setup & DBT Installation - Windows**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Virtual Environment**

Open windows command prompt and run the following commands to create virtual environment:

```sh
cd Desktop
mkdir course
cd course

virtualenv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ dbt installation**

```sh
cd course
virtualenv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install dbt-snowflake==1.9.0 # adjust accordind to compatibility
```

### \*\*3Ô∏è‚É£ dbt setup

Initialize the dbt profiles folder on Windows:

```sh
# create directory to store profiles
mkdir %userprofile%\.dbt

# Create a dbt project (all platforms):
dbt init dbtlearn
```

## **Step 3: Setting up Github Integration**

Follow these steps to set up GitHub in your dbt project:

```sh
# Navigate to your dbt project directory
cd path/to/your/dbt_project

# Initialize a new Git repository
git init

# Make an initial commit
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"

# Add a remote repository (replace with your actual GitHub repo URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-dbt-repo.git

# Push the changes to remote repository,
git push -u origin main

# Create branch development which will be used by developer
git branch development

# Always use development branch to for development
git checkout development
```

> **Note:** I used `main` branch as my production branch for deployment.

After this the project setup is complete and then we can start the development.

# Macros

## 1. `calculate_price_metrics(group_by_column)`

### Purpose:

This macro calculates price-related metrics for Airbnb listings by grouping data based on the specified column. It provides insights into the number of listings, average price, total price, and the total available nights.

### SQL Logic:

- Groups listings by the specified column (e.g., `listing_name`).
- Counts the number of listings (`listing_count`).
- Calculates the average price of listings (`avg_price`).
- Computes the total accumulated price (`total_price`).
- Sums up the `minimum_nights` to get available nights (`available_nights`).
- Filters out listings where `price` is NULL.

### Use Case:

## This macro is useful for generating aggregated price reports based on different groupings, such as by listing name, host, or room type.

## 2. `count_hosts_by_month(year)`

### Purpose:

This macro calculates the number of hosts who joined the platform in each month for a given year.

### SQL Logic:

- Extracts the month from the `created_at` timestamp.
- Formats the month name to a three-letter format (e.g., "Jan", "Feb").
- Counts the number of unique hosts who joined in each month.
- Filters data based on the provided `year` argument.
- Groups by month and orders the results in chronological order.

### Use Case:

## This macro helps in understanding the seasonality of host sign-ups, allowing businesses to analyze trends over time.

## 3. `get_years_from_created_at()`

### Purpose:

This macro dynamically retrieves the distinct years from the `created_at` column in the `dim_hosts_cleansed` model.

### SQL Logic:

- Runs a query to extract unique years from the `created_at` column.
- Sorts the years in ascending order.
- Uses Jinja's `run_query` function to execute the query at runtime.
- Returns the retrieved years as a list.
- Handles execution context to ensure it runs only during query execution.

### Use Case:

## This macro is particularly useful when iterating over different years in dbt models or reports, allowing dynamic and flexible queries without hardcoding year values.

# dbt Snapshots for Airbnb Data

## Overview

This document explains the dbt snapshots created for tracking changes in Airbnb host and listing data over time. Snapshots enable us to capture historical changes in records, ensuring we maintain a history of updates to important attributes.

## Purpose of Snapshots

Snapshots allow us to:

- Track changes in key attributes of hosts and listings.
- Maintain historical records of changes over time.
- Ensure we have accurate insights into when data was modified.
- Support audit requirements and historical trend analysis.

## Snapshot: `raw_hosts_snapshot`

### Definition

The `raw_hosts_snapshot` tracks changes in host details using a timestamp-based strategy.

### Configuration:

- `target_schema='dev'` - Stores snapshots in the `dev` schema.
- `unique_key='unique_id'` - Uniquely identifies each record using a surrogate key.
- `strategy='timestamp'` - Uses the `updated_at` timestamp to track changes.
- `updated_at='updated_at'` - Defines which column indicates an update.
- `invalidate_hard_deletes=True` - Marks deleted records as invalidated instead of removing them.

### Columns Tracked:

- `host_id` - Unique identifier for the host.
- `host_name` - Name of the host.
- `is_superhost` - Indicates if the host is a superhost.
- `created_at` - Timestamp when the host joined.
- `updated_at` - Last update timestamp.

### Unique Identifier:

A surrogate key is generated using:

```sql
{{ dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key(['host_id', 'host_name', 'is_superhost', 'created_at', 'updated_at']) }}
```

This ensures uniqueness even if individual fields change over time.

## Snapshot: `raw_listings_snapshot`

### Definition

The `raw_listings_snapshot` captures changes in listing details, tracking modifications in pricing, availability, and metadata.

### Configuration:

- `target_schema='dev'` - Stores snapshots in the `dev` schema.
- `unique_key='listing_id'` - Uses `listing_id` as the primary key.
- `strategy='timestamp'` - Uses `updated_at` to track modifications.
- `updated_at='updated_at'` - Specifies the update timestamp column.
- `invalidate_hard_deletes=True` - Ensures deleted records are marked invalid.

### Columns Tracked:

- `listing_id` - Unique identifier for the listing.
- `listing_url` - URL of the Airbnb listing.
- `listing_name` - Name of the listing.
- `room_type` - Type of room (e.g., Private room, Entire home, etc.).
- `minimum_nights` - Minimum number of nights required for booking.
- `host_id` - Foreign key referencing the host.
- `price_str` - Price per night for the listing.
- `created_at` - Timestamp when the listing was created.
- `updated_at` - Last update timestamp.

# **DBT Incremental Model: `dim_listings_cleansed`**

## **üìå Overview**

This model processes raw Airbnb listings data from the `src_listings` table and performs:  
‚úî Data Cleaning (handling nulls, standardizing values)  
‚úî Price Transformation (removing non-numeric characters)  
‚úî Incremental Processing (loading only new/updated records)

---

## ** Incremental Strategy**

This model is **incremental**, meaning:

- The first run **loads all data**.
- Subsequent runs **only process new/updated records** (based on `updated_at`).

### ** Incremental Logic:**

```sql
{% if is_incremental() %}
AND updated_at > (SELECT MAX(updated_at) FROM {{ this }})
{% endif %}
```

# **üöÄ DBT Automation with GitHub Actions**

This repository contains **GitHub Actions workflows** for automating **DBT (Data Build Tool) execution**.  
The workflows ensure **continuous integration (CI/CD), scheduled daily execution, and weekly execution** for DBT models.

---

# **DBT CI/CD Pipeline**

## **Overview**

This GitHub Actions workflow automates the Continuous Integration (CI) process for a dbt project using Snowflake as the data warehouse. The workflow runs on every push and pull request to the `main` branch, ensuring that dbt models, tests, and builds are validated before deployment.

## **Workflow Trigger**

- **Push to `main` branch**: Runs when new commits are pushed to the main branch.
- **Pull requests to `main`**: Runs when a pull request is created or updated.

## **Jobs**

### **1. Checkout Code**

```yaml
- name: Checkout code
  uses: actions/checkout@v3
```

This step pulls the latest version of the repository so that the workflow has access to the dbt project files.

### **2. Create `profiles.yml`**

```yaml
- name: Create profiles.yml
  run: |
    mkdir -p ~/.dbt
    cat > ~/.dbt/profiles.yml <<EOL
    dbt_assignment_2:
      outputs:
        dev:
          type: snowflake
          account: "${{ secrets.DBT_ACCOUNT }}"
          user: "${{ secrets.DBT_USER }}"
          password: "${{ secrets.DBT_PASSWORD }}"
          role: "${{ secrets.DBT_ROLE }}"
          warehouse: "${{ secrets.DBT_WAREHOUSE }}"
          database: "${{ secrets.DBT_DATABASE }}"
          schema: "${{ secrets.DBT_SCHEMA }}"
          threads: 4
      target: dev
    EOL
```

This step generates the `profiles.yml` configuration file required for dbt to connect to Snowflake. It uses GitHub Secrets to securely store credentials.

### **3. Set Up Python**

```yaml
- name: Set up Python
  uses: actions/setup-python@v4
  with:
    python-version: "3.10"
```

This step installs Python 3.10, which is required to run dbt.

### **4. Install dbt**

```yaml
- name: Install dbt
  run: |
  python -m pip install --upgrade pip
  pip install dbt-core==1.9.2 dbt-snowflake==1.9.1
```

This step installs dbt and the Snowflake adapter (`dbt-snowflake`).

### **5. Run dbt Commands**

```yaml
- name: Run dbt commands
  run: |
    dbt debug
    dbt deps
    dbt compile
```

This step executes the following dbt commands:

- `dbt debug`: Ensures the connection to Snowflake is working.
- `dbt deps`: Installs package dependencies.
- `dbt compile`: Prepares SQL queries for execution.
- `dbt run`: Executes the dbt models.

### **6. Run dbt build**

```yaml
- name: Run dbt build
  run: |
    dbt build
```

This step runs dbt tests to validate the data quality and integrity.

### **7. Run dbt Build**

```yaml
- name: Run dbt build
  run: |
    dbt build
```

This step runs `dbt build`, which executes models, tests, snapshots, and seeds in a single command.
